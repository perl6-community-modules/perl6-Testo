# NAME

Testo - Test.pm6 Done Right

# SYNOPSIS

```perl6
    use WWW;

    # Just GET content (will return Failure on failure):
    say get 'https://httpbin.org/get?foo=42&bar=x';

    # GET and decode received data as JSON:
    say jget('https://httpbin.org/get?foo=42&bar=x')<args><foo>;

    # POST content (query args are OK; pass form as named args)
    say post 'https://httpbin.org/post?foo=42&bar=x', :some<form>, :42args;

    # And if you need headers, pass them inside a positional Hash:
    say post 'https://httpbin.org/post?foo=42&bar=x', %(:Some<Custom-Header>),
        :some<form>, :42args;

    # Same POST as above + decode response as JSON
    say jpost('https://httpbin.org/post', :some<form>)<args><some>;
```

# DESCRIPTION

The `Test.pm6` module that ships with Rakudo does the job, but a large
portion of its design is influenced by Perl 5 test modules, making it less than
ideal for testing Perl 6 code.

Testo is the New and Improved version of `Test.pm6` that you can use
*instead* of `Test.pm6` to test all of your code!
